## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [@xuho](https://github.com/xuho)'s open-source project, [Code2Image](https://github.com/xuho/code2image). I admire Nguyen Hoa's work and his contributions to the open-source community. 

This project has been a great resource for learning about React workflows, efficiently using Tailwind CSS, exploring UI component libraries, and implementing simple state management with Zustand.
